## [0.4.0] - unreleased
### Added
- Add `global_seq` and `group_seq` to `Client`, sequence numbers assigned to test instance by the sync service. See [PR 29]

### Change
- Move `RunParameters` to a field on `Client`. See [PR 29].

- Don't wait for network when no sidecar. See [PR 27].

- Make `RunParameters::test_group_instance_count` a `u64` to be consistent with
  `RunParameters::test_instance_count`. See [PR 26].

- Replace `Client::new` with `Client::new_and_init`, waiting for the network to
  initialize, claiming global and group sequence numbers, as well as waiting for
  other instances to do the same. Also makes `Client::wait_network_initialized`
  private, as it is included in `Client::new_and_init` now. See [PR 25].

- Use a JSON Payload instead of string in `publish` and `subscribe`. See [PR 34].
